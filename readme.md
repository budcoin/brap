Project Brap
My project is an embedded Linux computer paired with a microcontroller that will record and display data from my 2012 Kawasaki ZX-6R race motorcycle using sensors and GPS; 
A Data logging Telemetry system with a Lap Timer.  
The System will measure lap time, suspension use, x,y,and,z g-forces, acceleration, braking, tire temperatures, and external temperatures.

Feel free to grab code and play, I have not commited any sensor code. That is soon to come. 
Thanks Frank!!!!
